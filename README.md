## Pinboard.in Chrome Extension ##

This beautiful chrome extension allow you to add bookmarks to your pinboard easily, using chrome browser actions.

We're not yet to a production version, and there is more work to come after the first release. I'm actively developping this extension, since I can't find a similar extension that fits my needs, or simply works â€” and I really need one.

You can fork it, PR your works, any tweaks, refactors or new features. I'll be very glad to pull any contributions that will make this extension more useful or even more beautiful.
